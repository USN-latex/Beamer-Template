This is a style for creating USN-presentations with the Beamer package and pdfLaTeX.

As a minimum, copy the files beamerthemehsn.sty and usnlogo.pdf to
the directory where you work on your presentation. As an alternative,
install them at the common place for such files on your system.

The files are:

README                This file
usnlogo.pdf           The logo of USN
beamerthemeusn.sty    Style file for USN presentation
usntemplate.tex       An example presentation that can be used as template
usntemplate.pdf       The pdf resulting from compiling usntemplate.tex
