This is a style for creating HSN-presentations with the Beamer package and pdflatex.

As a minimum, copy the directory gfx and the file beamerthemehsn.sty to
the directory where you work on your presentation. As an alternative,
install them at the common place appropriate for your system.

The files are:

README                This file
hsnlogo.pdf           The logo of HSN
beamerthemehsn.sty    Style file for HSN presentation
hsntemplate.tex       An example presentation that can be used as template
hsntemplate.pdf       The pdf resulting from compiling hsntemplate.tex
